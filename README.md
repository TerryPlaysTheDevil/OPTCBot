# OPTCBot

OPTCBot is my highly customized Reddit bot. It works exclusively on /r/OnePieceTC, where it supports me and the moderation team with some of the more annoying or flat out impossible (for human volunteers) tasks. I've also added some functionality for our users. Currently, it's workload includes:
 - Controlling comments in our Giveaways
 - Monitoring users on probation
 - Enforcing flairs on new submissions
 - Dynamically updating our linkbox
 - Fetching, parsing and presenting data from the great guys at optc-db.github.io on command

# Tech

Big shoutout to the great guys behind [PRAW](praw.readthedocs.io), without them this bot simply wouldn't exist.
